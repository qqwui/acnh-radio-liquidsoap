# Animal Crossing New Horizons Internet Radio - Liquidsoap edition
These are the scripts I used to make the new ACNH internet radio. Unlike [acnh-radio-archive](https://github.com/qqwui/acnh-radio-archive/), this uses liquidsoap so tracks are properly queued and not just streamed directly from the file.

*Songs must be added yourself. I am not responsible for Nintendo nuking your home*
