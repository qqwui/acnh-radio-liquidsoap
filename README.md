# Animal Crossing New Horizons Internet Radio - Liquidsoap edition
These are the scripts I used to make the [ACNH internet radio](https://airedale-relieved-adversely.ngrok-free.app/). Unlike [acnh-radio-archive](https://github.com/qqwui/acnh-radio-archive/), this uses liquidsoap so tracks are properly queued and not just streamed directly from the file.

*Songs must be added yourself. I am not responsible for Nintendo nuking your home*
